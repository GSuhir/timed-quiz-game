  <h1>Welcome to Gene's Coding Quiz!</h1>
  <h2>Before we get started, please get acquainted with the rules:</h2>
  <h3 class="rules">You will be presented with 5 multiple choice questions.  Answer all correctly in under 60 seconds for a score of 5.  Otherwise, your score will be 0.  Might seem unfair, but you'll have have a chance to guess again if you're wrong the first time (though you'll lose 10 seconds).  Sound good?</h3>
